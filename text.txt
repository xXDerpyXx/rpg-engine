prompt 3
first things first, to make a sorta prompt, something to show a question or statement like this one you use prompt [number], prompt 1 is always first
can I use words instead of that number?

cool! how do I actually write the words in my statement?

end

prompt 4
you can use a single word string, NO SPACES! but, in most situations atleast, you can
return to last prompt

end

prompt 5
good question, you just add your statement on the next line after naming the prompt
but how do I make these options?

end

prompt 6
easy peasy! you just write the option's text, then the prompt it goes to on the next line
how do I end my story though?

just replace the prompt name after your option with "endstory", that will end the program
go back to start
